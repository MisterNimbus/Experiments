# Sprite Animations with JS

Created an interactive site to get familiar with animating and inputs using hmtl canvas and javascript. 
Character on the right keeps running unless "A" is pressed (he stops until the key is released) or "S" is pressed (he starts sliding until the key is released).
Pressed keys are shown on the left (they turn red while pressed).

## Sprites
The sprite I have used was also done by me some years ago. It can only start running, run and slide. Should you want to try this yourself here are the loops:  
  
Frames 1->2 - Starts running  
Frames 3->14 - Running loop  
Frames 14->18 - start sliding  
Frames 18->14 - stop sliding

I had also done more than just a character. This was supposed to be a simple sidescroller/obsticle avoidance game, 
in which the character runs and avoids skulls/demons by jumping over them or sliding under them. The colummns were supposed to be used in the several background layers
with parallax effect to give the illusion of depth and movement. Maybe one day I will be returning to this project. Here is the full tileset/sprite sheet.
