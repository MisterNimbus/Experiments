# ApproxPi

In this experiment I try approximating the Pi using the Monte Carlo Method. A demonstration of how practical probability approaches theoretical probability as the number of trials increase.  

In this case the ratio of randomly placed dots inside a square and of those inside the largest cocentric circle fitting inside the square approach the ratio of their respective areas. From this ratio it becomes trivial to extract the pi.

I took inspiration from the following coding challenge although I have coded everything independently:
