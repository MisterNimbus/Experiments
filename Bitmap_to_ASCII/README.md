# Bitmap to ASCII

Creates various 2 dimensional integer arrays using mathematical functions and visualizes them through ASCII characters. Also shows the visualizations as a slideshow, offsetting the functions creating the illusion of waves propagating.


Since this was just an experiment the code is messy and I dont intend to waste precious time improving it. I am planning to write similar programms in the future to keep exploring the ASCII art culture.

Special thanks to my dear friend Berk Adým for his accompany and bright ideas tweaking the sinusoids.
