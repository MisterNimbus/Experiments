# Bitmap to ASCII

Creates various 2 dimensional integer arrays using mathematical functions and visualizes them through ASCII characters. Also shows the visualizations as a slideshow, offsetting the functions creating the illusion of waves propagating.


Since this was just an experiment the code is messy and I dont intend to waste precious time improving it. I am planning to write similar programms in the future to keep exploring the ASCII art culture.
