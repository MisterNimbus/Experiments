# Pi with blocks

In this experiment I try to calculate the digits of pi from the number of elastic collisions between two blocks in a system where energy and momentum is conserved.

In my demonstation it can be observed that as the difference between the masses of the blocks increase the block with more mass starts to squeeze the other block to the wall. This occurs due to the constant spacing of frames in time not allowing the small block to bounce back and forth more than once per frame. This however does not affect the result as long as the block with more mass never reaches the wall, since the amount of collisions and therefore the number of impulses remain the same.

I won't be explaining why the digits of pi appear before us because it was explained much better than I can here by 3Blue1Brown in the following videos which also inspired this project alongside The Coding Train who also coded the demonstration of the same concept (once again I coded my version independently from the video):
